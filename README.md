# Stroustrup-book-exercises
My answers for the exercises in the C++ Programming Principles and Practices book by Bjarne Stroustrup.

Each chapter folder has code for the Drills and Exercises at the end of the chapter.  There is also a
text file, called ch<chapter number>review, which has my answers for the reviews.  I'm assuming you are
viewing it with wordwrap.  If not...I guess that will be a bit tricky.
